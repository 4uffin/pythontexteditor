## **Features**

* **Syntax Highlighting:** Supports basic Python syntax highlighting to improve code readability.  
* **Multi-Tab Support:** Open and manage multiple files in a tabbed interface.  
* **Line Numbering:** A custom widget provides line numbers for easy navigation.  
* **Theme Toggling:** Switch between a modern light mode and a comfortable dark mode.  
* **Find and Replace:** A dedicated dialog for searching and replacing text within the current document.  
* **Status Bar:** Real-time information on the current line, word count, and character count.

## **Prerequisites**

To run PyEdit, you need to have Python and the PyQt6 library installed.

pip install PyQt6
